                    <p>Hangman is a popular word guessing game where the player attempts to build a missing word by
                        guessing one letter at a time.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The program randomly generates a secret word and indicates its length with
                            according number of underscores</li>
                        <li>The player guesses one letter at a time </li>
                        <li>After 6 incorrect guesses the player loses and the game ends</li>
                        <li>The game also ends if the player correctly identifies all the letters of the secret word</li>
                        <li>Player is not penalized for guessing a letter they already tried</li>
                        <li>Regardless of the final result player can choose to start a new game or finish & exit</li>

        Welcome to Hangman!
        This is your secret word:
        _ _ _ _ _ _
        Guess a letter: e
        _ _ _ _ E _
        Guess a letter: t
        _ _ T _ E _
        Guess a letter: a
        A _ T _ E A
        Guess a letter: o
        No such letter! Try a different one.
        You have 5 (incorrect) guesses left.
        Guess a letter: n
        No such letter! Try a different one.
        You have 4 (incorrect) guesses left.
        Guess a letter: s
        No such letter! Try a different one.
        You have 3 (incorrect) guesses left.
        Guess a letter: r
        No such letter! Try a different one.
        You have 2 (incorrect) guesses left.
        Guess a letter: d
        No such letter! Try a different one.
        You have 1 (incorrect) guesses left.
        Guess a letter: l
        A L T _ E A
        Guess a letter: m
        No such letter! Try a different one.
        You have 0 (incorrect) guesses left.
        Guess a letter: p
        You lost! You have reached the maximum number of incorrect guesses (6).
        The secret word was --> ALTHEA <--
        Why don't you try again? :)
        To play press '1', to exit press '2': 2
        See you soon!
