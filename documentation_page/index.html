                    <p>Hangman is a popular word guessing game where the player attempts to build a missing word by
                        guessing one letter at a time.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The program randomly generates a secret word and indicates its length with
                            according number of underscores</li>
                        <li>The player guesses one letter at a time </li>
                        <li>After 6 incorrect guesses the player loses and the game ends</li>
                        <li>The game also ends if the player correctly identifies all the letters of the secret word</li>
                        <li>Player is not penalized for guessing a letter they already tried</li>
                        <li>Regardless of the final result player can choose to start a new game or finish & exit</li>
